# Madoc - A World Generator
This is a personal project of mine to get even more familiar with OpenGL and C++. Done in collaboration with a mentor through the LaunchPad club at Purdue.

See /external for the different external libraries vendored in, such as GLAD and GLFW.
## To-Do
- Voronoi cell generation logic [DONE]
- Bitmask logic for a specific Voronoi cell [DONE]
- Converting Voronoi cells into veritces [IN PROGRESS]
- Triangularizing Voronoi cells (ear clipping)
- Properly rendering a full grid of Voronoi cells
- Changing Voronoi cell attributes based on Perlin noise
- ...and more
